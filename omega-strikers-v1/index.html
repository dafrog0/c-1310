        Odyssey Interactive has implemented a variety of new layers of strategy
        and progression to Omega Strikers in the lead up to launch and will
        continue to expand the competitive experience through extensive
        post-launch live service programming. Each matchup will now play out
        over three potential rounds and provide players with short breaks to
        upgrade abilities based on their individual performance in the previous
        round. Arenas are being overhauled to each feature unique layouts and
        environmental obstacles, including hazards and buffs, requiring their
        own strategies while being packed with immersive art and animations to
        set the tone. A variety of new gameplay features have also been added to
        augment progression including the Striker Affinity system as well as the
        tactical Core Flip skill, a special one-use-per-match ability that
        knocks away opponents and gives you a chance to strike first. Players
        can also look forward to new Quick Chat functionality, an enhanced
        visual experience both in and out of matches, additional collectible
        cosmetics and much more at launch.
