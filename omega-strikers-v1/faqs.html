        <dd>
          Odyssey will support a competitive scene if the community is large
          enough and is hungry for one. We don't believe in shoehorning a
          competitive ecosystem into a game, and would rather work with players
          on building a scene that makes sense for them and the title.

          Is Omega Strikers a Web3 game and will you integrate NFTs or

        </dt>
        <dd>
          No, we're building games the old fashioned way with no plans to
          integrate either NFTs or web3 technology.
