  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>
    Web accessibility means allowing as many people as possible to use your website, including people who are 
    older, blind, deaf, new to the internet, have motor disabilities or cognitive disabilities. This requires a level of empathy by imagining
    what their experience on your website would be like and allowing a smooth as possible experience for them just
    like any other person.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is important because not accommodating for these people automatically reduces the number of potential
    users on your site. About 13% of Americans have disabilities. And it's not just about increasing traffic flow
    to your website. The main aspect of web accesibility is thoughtfulness which can take practice.
